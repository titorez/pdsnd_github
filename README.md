### Project Title
Bikeshare Data Analysis

### Description
This Python code allows you to analyze bikeshare data for three cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington. It provides insights into various aspects of bikeshare usage, including the most frequent times of travel, popular stations and trips, trip duration statistics, and user statistics.

### Files used
The dataset used for this analysis is in CSV format for each city:

- `chicago.csv`
- `new_york_city.csv`
- `washington.csv`

The data includes information about bike rides, such as start time, end time, trip duration, start station, end station, user type, gender (not available for Washington), and birth year (not available for Washington).

### Credits
This project was developed as part of the Udacity Programming for Data Science Nanodegree program.
